# Functional Interface with Lambda Expressions in Java

This project demonstrates the use of functional interfaces and lambda expressions in Java.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main files:

- `NumberProcessor.java`: This file defines a functional interface named `NumberProcessor` with a single abstract method `process(int number)`.
- `Main.java`: This file contains a `main` method that creates instances of `NumberProcessor` using lambda expressions and applies them to a set of numbers.

## Usage

To run the project, execute the `Main.java` file. The program will apply three operations (doubling, squaring, and incrementing) to a set of numbers and print the results.

## Reflection

Using lambda expressions with functional interfaces simplifies the implementation by reducing the amount of boilerplate code. It also enhances the readability of the code by making it more concise and expressive. The operations are defined right where they are used, making the code easier to understand.
